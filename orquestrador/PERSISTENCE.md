# Orquestrador Maestro — Persistence Contract

Chat history is not durable project memory. Every supported software must recover and persist work through the same files and protocol.

## Rehydrate before work

When a project contains `DEV/`, read the files that exist in this order:

1. `DEV/README.md` or `DEV/INDEX.md`
2. `DEV/HANDOFF.md`
3. `DEV/CONTEXT.md`
4. `DEV/SPECS/ACTIVE.md`
5. only the task-relevant detail files

Do not infer missing context from an old chat, another tool, or memory. If the compact files conflict, follow the nearest project instructions and record the decision in the project memory.

## Persist after substantive work

Before ending a session, switching tools, or handing work to another agent:

- update `DEV/WORKLOG.md` with a short entry containing change, reason, verification, and next context;
- refresh `DEV/VERIFY.md` with the checks and their results;
- refresh `DEV/HANDOFF.md` with current state, remaining work, risks, and exact next action;
- update `DEV/CONTEXT.md`, `DEV/INDEX.md`, or `DEV/SPECS/ACTIVE.md` when their state changes.

If the project has no `DEV/`, initialize it with `orquestrador-maestro init-dev --project-path <project>` before substantive work when the user or repository allows project documentation changes.

## One operating contract

Codex, OpenCode, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, Antigravity, and compatible agents must treat `AGENTS.md`, `.orquestrador/rules.md`, `.orquestrador/maestro.md`, and this file as the shared source of truth. Tool-specific memories, commands, and hooks may accelerate recovery, but must not replace these files.
